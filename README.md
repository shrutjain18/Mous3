# Mous3 – A 3D Space Mouse

**Judge’s Choice Award – TechEvince 10.0, IIT Guwahati**

Mous3 is a custom-built 3D space mouse designed for intuitive multi-axis navigation in 3D environments such as CAD, virtual reality, and 3D modeling software. Built using 3D-printed parts, joysticks, and a microcontroller, it offers a highly affordable and ergonomic alternative to commercial 6-DoF input devices.

## 🚀 Features

- 6 Degrees of Freedom (6-DoF) control using three analog joysticks
- Real-time motion tracking and signal processing via microcontroller
- Ergonomic and compact design, optimized using Autodesk Fusion 360
- Fully 3D-printed outer casing using PLA
- Tested in Blender for real-time 3D interaction

## 🎯 Objectives

- Create a cost-effective alternative to expensive 3D input devices
- Ensure ergonomic design suitable for extended use
- Demonstrate the power of 3D printing in hardware prototyping
- Validate functionality through real-world 3D software testing

## 🛠️ Components Used

- 3 × Analog Joysticks
- 1 × Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino-compatible board)
- PLA filament (for 3D-printed body)
- Wires, adhesives, and fasteners

## 🧩 System Design

- The mouse body is modeled in Autodesk Fusion 360 with attention to hand placement and structural support.
- Joysticks are mounted at the vertices of a triangular prism for capturing motion in all axes.
- Joystick data is processed through mathematical computation to infer rotational and translational motion.

## 🧪 Testing & Results

- Device tested in Blender for 3D control responsiveness
- High precision in motion capture and smooth signal processing
- Durable print quality and comfortable usage

## 💸 Cost Breakdown

- Market alternatives: ₹15,000–₹20,000  
- Mous3 build: ₹1,000–₹1,500  
> *Cost can be significantly reduced with bulk production.*

## 📦 Files Included

- `/hardware` – 3D model files (.stl/.f3d)
- `/code` – Microcontroller firmware
- `/docs` – Final project report and references

## 📚 Future Improvements

- Add advanced sensors (gyroscopes, IMUs) for finer motion capture
- Integrate wireless communication for untethered use
- Implement programmable buttons for quick tool access
